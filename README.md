The repository content is designed to make participation in Learning from Big Data as easy and enjoyable for you as possible. The content of this repo is being continuously updated until the last day of classes. 

In the lectures, we will use R to illustrate implementation-related key points. The code files will be published in this repository ahead of the lecture. Please make sure that you can execute the code, and solve eventual challenges, before joining the class so you can easily follow the coding parts in the lectures.  

For the homework assignment, use the structure found in the final assignment RMarkdown file, available in this repo.

## Getting up to speed

If you are not familiar with R markdown please go through this short tutorial in the following link.

- [Introduction to R and R markdown](https://github.com/guiliberali/Learning-from-Big-Data-Module-1/blob/main/preparation/Intro-to-RMarkdown.pdf)

Greta Wackerbauer, our TA (learningbigdata22@gmail.com) will review and discuss this short tutorial on Rmarkdown on September 2 at 3pm (i.e., right after the first lecture) and see if anyone has any questions on how to use R and RMarkdown. Feel free to attend if you would like to get some tips, but do make sure you first try to install R studio and R Markdown on your computer before the class.
